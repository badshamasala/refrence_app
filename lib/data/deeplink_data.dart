It’s not just a state of mind, it has an impact on bodily responses. Here’s the thing. Your body can’t tell the difference between a mental threat and a physical threat. So, when you imagine stressful situations like looming deadlines, your body treats it like it’s really under attack – like a bear is chasing it, for instance. In such a perceived fight or flight situation, the body releases stress hormones like adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol internally."
